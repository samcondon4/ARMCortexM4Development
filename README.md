This repo contains sample projects I have developed on the NXP K65F MCU.
The K65F uses an ARM Cortex M4 core. Projects found in baremetal/ were written in 
baremetal C whereas projects found in uCOS/ were written in C running on Micrium's 
Micro-C Operating System.

In these projects I use some external modules which I do not have included in
this remote repository. many of these modules were written by professor todd morton
at western washington university.  if there are questions about modules not included 
in these directories email me or raise an issue. i also do not include any files 
associated with Micro C-OS. Only source code written by myself or in collaboration with 
another student is included here.

The most interesting project included in these directories is /uCOS/FunctionGenerator.
This is one of my most recent efforts in embedded systems development and is a project
I completed in collaboration with a fellow student at Western Washington University.
