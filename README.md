This repo contains sample projects I have developed on the NXP K65F MCU.
The K65F uses an ARM Cortex M4 core and all code is developed in baremetal C.

In these projects I use some external modules which I do not have included in
this remote repository.  One of these modules is BasicIO written by Professor Todd Morton
at Western Washington University.  If there are questions about this module, or any others 
used in these projects, please send me an email or raise an issue.
